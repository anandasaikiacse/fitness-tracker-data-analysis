# Fitness Tracker Data Analysis

This project explores fitness tracker data to analyze user activity trends, health metrics, and behavioral patterns.

## Dataset

A sample dataset (`fitness_data.csv`) includes daily metrics such as:

> Steps
> Calories Burned
> Distance (KM)
> Active Minutes
> Sleep Hours
> Resting Heart Rate

## Features

> Time series analysis of daily activity
> Correlation between sleep, steps, and heart rate
> Visual insights into fitness behavior

## Visualizations

> Line plot of daily steps and sleep
> Correlation heatmap of all metrics
> Heart rate trends over the week

### Requirements

Install the dependencies:

```bash
> pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

2) Calories Burned
3) Distance (KM)
4) Active Minutes
5) Sleep Hours
6) Resting Heart Rate

## Features :

1) Time series analysis of daily activity
2) Correlation between sleep, steps, and heart rate
3) Visual insights into fitness behavior

## Visualizations :

1) Line plot of daily steps and sleep
2) Correlation heatmap of all metrics
3) Heart rate trends over the week

### Requirements :

1) Install the dependencies:

```bash
> pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

2) Run the analysis:

```bash
> python analysis.py
```
